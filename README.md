This project is a recreation of the article "Linearized Dynamics Equations for the Balance and Steer of a Bicycle: A Benchmark and Review." 
I used Lagrangian mechanics to derive the equations from scratch and verified their accuracy. 
The derivations are documented in the attached PDF and Word files. 
In the accompanying IPYNB file, Iâ€™ve implemented the equations and provided several examples demonstrating how to control the bicycle for stability.
